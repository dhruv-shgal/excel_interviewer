## API Configuration

The app uses an external AI API for question generation and answer evaluation. The API key is included in the code for easy setup.

**For production deployment, consider:**
- Using environment variables for the API key
- Implementing rate limiting
- Using the built-in fallback mechanism when API limits are reached

## Sample Interview Runs

The code includes commented examples of:
- **Good Candidate**: Scores 10/10 with comprehensive answers
- **Weak Candidate**: Scores 2/10 with basic responses

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **AI Integration**: External AI API for question generation and evaluation
- **State Management**: Streamlit session state
- **Styling**: Clean Markdown formatting with minimal styling
- **Dependencies**: See requirements.txt

## Fallback System

The application includes a robust fallback mechanism to ensure uninterrupted functionality:

- **Automatic Detection**: Detects when API limits are reached or API errors occur
- **Predefined Questions**: Uses a curated set of Excel interview questions organized by difficulty level
- **Seamless Transition**: Switches to fallback questions without disrupting the user experience
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Maintains the same difficulty progression as the AI-generated questions

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **API Errors**: Check your internet connection and API service status
2. **API Limits**: The application will automatically fall back to predefined questions when API limits are reached
3. **Empty Answers**: Make sure to provide detailed answers before submitting

**Performance Tips:**
- Use a stable internet connection
- Provide detailed answers for better evaluation
- If you encounter API limits, the fallback system will ensure the application continues to function

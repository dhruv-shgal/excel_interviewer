# Excel Mock Interviewer - Design Document

## Overview
The Excel Mock Interviewer is an AI-powered application designed to simulate technical interviews focused on Microsoft Excel skills. It provides a structured interview experience with progressively difficult questions, real-time evaluation, and comprehensive feedback.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Question Generation System**
   - Generates Excel interview questions with progressive difficulty levels
   - Implements fallback mechanism for reliability
   - Organizes questions by topic and difficulty

2. **Answer Evaluation System**
   - Analyzes user responses against expected answers
   - Provides scoring on a 0-2 scale
   - Generates detailed feedback and improvement suggestions

3. **Session Management**
   - Tracks interview progress through 5 questions
   - Maintains user state throughout the interview
   - Handles session persistence

4. **Reporting System**
   - Generates comprehensive interview summaries
   - Provides personalized recommendations
   - Suggests learning resources based on performance

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **UI Components**:
  - Question display
  - Answer input area
  - Progress tracking
  - Results visualization
  - Feedback display

### Backend
- **Language**: Python
- **State Management**: Streamlit session state
- **External API Integration**: Generative AI API for question generation and answer evaluation
- **Fallback System**: Local question bank organized by difficulty level

### Data Flow
1. User initiates interview session
2. System generates question based on current difficulty level
3. User submits answer
4. System evaluates answer and provides feedback
5. Process repeats for all 5 questions
6. System generates comprehensive report

## Fallback Mechanism

The application implements a robust fallback system to ensure uninterrupted functionality:

1. **Primary Path**: Generate questions and evaluate answers using external AI API
2. **Error Detection**: Monitor API responses for errors or rate limiting
3. **Fallback Activation**: Automatically switch to local question bank when API issues are detected
4. **Seamless Experience**: Maintain consistent interview flow regardless of which system is active

## Progressive Difficulty Design

The interview follows a structured difficulty progression:

1. **Basic**: Fundamental Excel concepts (formulas, simple functions)
2. **Intermediate-Basic**: Common Excel functions (VLOOKUP, IF statements)
3. **Intermediate**: More advanced functions and techniques (INDEX/MATCH, pivot tables)
4. **Advanced-Intermediate**: Complex formulas and data manipulation
5. **Advanced**: Expert-level Excel skills (macros, dashboards, automation)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Customizable Interviews**: Allow users to select specific Excel topics
2. **Extended Question Bank**: Expand the local question repository
3. **Performance Analytics**: Track user progress across multiple interview sessions
4. **Interactive Tutorials**: Add learning resources for areas needing improvement
5. **Multi-language Support**: Expand to support interviews in multiple languages

## Technical Considerations

1. **API Usage Optimization**: Implement caching and request batching
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all API interactions
3. **Performance**: Optimize for quick response times
4. **Scalability**: Design to handle increased user load
5. **Security**: Protect API keys and user data
